My Awesome Readme File!
=========================

Section 1
===============================

This is a paragraph apparently. I will make *italics*
and **bold** text for fun.

   This paragraph hopefully should be indented although if it is not we
   can just fix it later because it'll be fun I guess. \* Not italics \*.

1. numbers
2. in
3. a
4. list

what
  Definition lists associate a term with a definition.

*how*
  The term is a one-line phrase, and the definition is one or more
  paragraphs or body elements, indented relative to the term.
  Blank lines are not allowed between term and definition.

Section 2
===============================

Serious code::

((lambda (x) (x x)) (lambda (x) (x x)))

End the code.
